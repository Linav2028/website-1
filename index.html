  <p class="about-me">
    The first image I used was a photo I took of a lake in Switzerland, this represents my Swiss heritage and the country is very important to me because I go there every summer and winter. The second picture was of the Statue of Liberty which is from NYC which is where I was born and raised. This is important to me because it’s all I have ever know and I wouldn’t want to live anywhere else. 
My third image was of a sky with an airplane flying across it. This represents me because I love to travel and my mom is a flight attendant. 
My fourth image was a castle from Lichtenstein which just represents another country I have been too. 
I was trying to go with a blue theme but still have different colors included in the final project
In terms of arranging the pictures I just choose the part of the picture that went along with the blue theme and would fit together with the other photos.
