  <p class="about-me">
    The first image I used was a photo I took of a lake in Switzerland, this represents my Swiss heritage and the country is very important to me because I go there every summer and winter. The second picture was of the Statue of Liberty which is from NYC which is where I was born and raised. This is important to me because it’s all I have ever know and I wouldn’t want to live anywhere else. 
My third image was of a sky with an airplane flying across it. This represents me because I love to travel and my mom is a flight attendant. 
My fourth image was a castle from Lichtenstein which just represents another country I have been too. 
I was trying to go with a blue theme but still have different colors included in the final project
In terms of arranging the pictures I just choose the part of the picture that went along with the blue theme and would fit together with the other photos.

For my first logo I created a more blocky V with a cursive L in the background. I was able to create this effect by having the V be filled and attempting to draw the L without using the line tool. My second logo was supposed to have more of a monogram affect. However, I think I should have included more color because it looks sightly plain. But, I do like the shape and simplicity of the logo overall. My 3rd logo was inspired by the mood board we made earlier. I was trying to go with the same aesthetic which is why I added a rose in a deeper shade and a slightly curvy line for decoration. On the bottom I added a quill because the topic is books and it had the same vibe as my mood board. My fourth and final logo was a mascot logo. My cat drawing skills could use some work as some people thought it look like a squid or an octopus. On the bottom I decided to put the sound a cat makes “meow” because that is what the logo was representing. In terms of the tools I sed I mostly used the simple line tool. I tried using other effects but I didn’t like them enough to include them in my final logos.
